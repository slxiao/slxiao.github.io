Hello, welcome to my homepage. My name is Xiao Shiliang (肖世良).

I received my Ph.D. degree at [Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology (SIMIT)](http://www.sim.ac.cn/), [Chinese Adacemy of Sciences (CAS)](http://www.cas.cn/) in Jul, 2015. During the Ph.D. career, I was also with the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.gucas.ac.cn/). My advisor was Prof. [Yuan Xiaobing](http://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_sim_cas/cn/expert/200907/t20090701_1884357.html). Previously, I spent one year studying pre-doctoral courses at EE department of [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/) from Sep, 2010 to Jul, 2011. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree at Department of [Electronic Information Technology and Instrument Science](http://www.cbeis.zju.edu.cn/) from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in Jun, 2010.

My research directions include 4G/5G wireless networks, Internet-of-Things, and networked systems design & applications.

After graduation, I stepped into the industry, and joined [Nokia Shanghai Bell](http://company.nokia.com/en) as an TD-LTE R&D Engineer. In Nokia, I have been envolved in the integration of Nokia-ALu radio products and the automated regression/verification of Nokia's 17 radio SW builds. 

I am currently working towards network function virtualization. Specifically, we are devoted to migrating part of the M-plane functionalities of BTUs to telco cloud so as to reserve more spatial/temporal resources for U-/C- plane operations and as a result, improve the transport performance of next-generation wireless networks.
